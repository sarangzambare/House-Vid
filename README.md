# Application to view a gamified view of a property/house
## Author: Sarang Zambare 
### Company: Housing.com

This program is part of a project in collaboration with housing.com.

This program makes uses of multiple 2D images of a property/house to generate a 
gamified walkthrough. The user can press the arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate through the property. 

The images used were provided by Housing.com camera crew. So far, we only managed to cover one property.

At the heart of the program, it uses sterescopic vision to ascertain depth from 2D images from multiple known perspectives.
Most of the time was utilised in animating the generated photo sequence, rather than coding the logic.


## Update: I have stopped working on this repository.
